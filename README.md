# Nerves-Mass
A breakout board for those interested in learning how to implement a load sensor.  
This specific board is intended for teaching/demonstrating the role that a PGA, an ADC, a selected load sensor, and excitation voltage have on output resolution, accuracy, SNR, linearity, hysteresis, etc. of a digitized analog signal.

IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN WRITING LIBRARIES FOR THIS BOARD FOR THE NERVES COMMUNITY PLEASE DM @JoelS IN THE [ELIXIR SLACK WORKSPACE](https://join.slack.com/t/elixir-lang/shared_invite/zt-1k85aju37-nrncutcefQ2kMNvVcHiGMQ).  WE CAN MAIL A FREE BOARD TO THE FIRST TWO PEOPLE!

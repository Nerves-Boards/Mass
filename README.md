# Nerves-Mass
A breakout board for those interested in learning how to implement a load sensor.  
This specific board is intended for teaching/demonstrating the role that a PGA, an ADC, a selected load sensor, and excitation voltage have on output resolution, accuracy, SNR, linearity, hysteresis, etc. of a digitized analog signal.

Feel free to reach out in the #Nerves-boards channel in the Elixir Slack Organization if you would like to contribute!
